Prion diseases are a group of transmissible, untreatable, and often fatal brain diseases which occur in mammals. These diseases are the result of a transition in the naturally occurring prion protein into an abnormal, misfolded state, leading to the formation structured aggregates within the brain and ultimately, irreversible neurodegeneration. This aggregation is often underway for years before symptoms become present. Although these diseases are incredibly rare (as few as 300 estimated cases in the United States per year), their aggressive nature and unique pathological manifestation have made them a topic of interest both throughout popular culture and within the scientific community.

The mechanisms and causes of misfolding in prions are still largely unknown. Without these insights, development of therapeutics is essentially impossible. Current research on prions has focused on various areas, including protein structure, biochemistry, and pathogenesis, as well as comparisons to other protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and ALS. This project will focus primarily on characterizing biochemical and structural dynamics within prions by analyzing the crystal structure of the human prion protein (PDB ID: 1QLX) and gathering insights on allosteric pathways within the protein structure. In the context of protein dynamics, allosteric pathways refer to networks of molecular interactions within a protein structure that allow signals (e.g. conformational changes) to propagate from one region of the protein to another. By identifying coupled residues and/or structural domains, the project aims to highlight regions which may play a critical role in the misfolding process.
